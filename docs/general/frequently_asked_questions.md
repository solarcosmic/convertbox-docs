# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
### How do I install BetterKMR?
Installing BetterKMR is easy! You can download the latest version from both the Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-ons. To install BetterKMR manually, you can download the latest release from the releases page.

### Why can't I add external JavaScript code to my custom theme?
Due to security concerns, this feature is not yet available, but is possibly planned.

### The navbar doesn't work well with my school's Kamar page?
This is a known issue and we're working on it. For now though, you can toggle the Dynamic Navbar option in the settings. Check the question below to join our Discord server.

### I'm having trouble with BetterKMR, where can I get help?
You can join the Discord server to get help from the developers.

### Why doesn't the extension work properly when I download the .zip from the main branch?
This is because the intention of BetterKMR is to be built before it can be actually used. You can either:
- Get BetterKMR from the Chrome Web Store (recommended).
- Use the prebuilt versions from the releases page or the GitHub workflow runs for cutting-edge development builds.
- Build BetterKMR yourself. You can find the instructions at the "Building & Developing" section in Guides.
