# üî® Building & Developing
<p style="color:rgb(121, 121, 121);">‚ÑπÔ∏è <span style="font-style: italic;">This guide assumes you want to build BetterKMR from the GitHub repository and be able to modify its source code. If you do not know what this means, it's best to leave this guide.</span></p>

In v1.0.1, BetterKMR shifted from the pure vanilla experience to a more modern, Webpack-based experience. This guide will show you how to build and modify BetterKMR.

### Cloning and basic running/building (from the README)
To build this project, you must have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. You can use [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx) and other alternatives if you prefer.
You can easily get BetterKMR up and running by building in a matter of minutes. Please note that this is intended for development purposes, and we suggest getting this extension via the Chrome Web Store otherwise. To start, just clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Interlabs-Official/BetterKMR.git
```
Once done, change your current directory to the newly cloned one and run `npm install` to gather the required dependencies.
```
cd BetterKMR
npm install
```
Note that `npm install` may show a few warnings. This is fine to ignore for now.
To start using an almost live-refreshable version of BetterKMR (for active developing purposes), do the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
If you would like to build BetterKMR for browsers:
```
npm run build:chrome
# or
npm run build:firefox
# or for both
npm run build:all
```
Please note that the compiled version of BetterKMR will be available in the `dist` folder. This includes the live-refreshable version as well. To learn how to import your built extension into the browser, follow [this guide](/develop/how_to_test_new_builds#enabling-the-extension-on-chrome), but instead of the zip folder, use your built `dist` folder.

### Modifying the code
To modify the code, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended, but you can use your preferred IDE. A lot of what you need has already been covered above, but here's the folders and what purpose they have:
- `src/` - This is where most of the tweakable code is located (e.g. themes, modules, etc.)
- `docs/` - This is where the documentation for BetterKMR is located (what you're reading)
- `dist/` - This is where the compiled version of BetterKMR is located. This includes the live-refreshable version as well.
- `details/` - This is where extra details are located, for example, class name tooltips.
- `frameworks/` - A folder containing necessary frameworks for BetterKMR to function correctly.
- `settings/` - Contains settings related files, such as the settings page and the code editor.
- `icon/` - Contains icon assets for BetterKMR.
- `assets/` - Contains other assets, such as theme backgrounds and misc images.

### My changes aren't always being reflected!
If you're modifying internal code, you may notice Webpack (the bundling tool & live refresher) doesn't always reflect those changes. In this case, you'll need to manually refresh the extension. This is a known issue and we're unsure if this will be fixed in the future.

### Have fun!
Have fun messing around with the code! Remember that:
- The code in `src/` is designed to be modular, so you can easily add your own modules or themes. However, custom themes should really be added in Settings.
- Always stick to the AGPL-3.0 license when modifying the code.
- BetterKMR is intended to be a community-driven project, so if you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request on the GitHub repo or via our Discord server.
