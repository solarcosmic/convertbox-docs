# v1.1.1 Changelog
v1.1.1 Released! New feature, small changes and a couple bug patches. Visual Theme Editor may be referred to as VTE.

### **New Features**
- Ability to Import/Export Custom Themes, as a .BKT file (VTE only) or a .CSS file (global)

### **New Themes**
- Minecraft Theme - Convy32
- Ocean Theme - Solar

### **Changes**
- Added Surveys & Notes to Dynamic Navbar
- Add link text colour & more border colour options (VTE)
- Refreshed some layouts (e.g. Custom tab) in the Settings page (and buttons too!)
- Rearranged order of themes to push new ones higher up
- VTT now tells you if a background image is too small (pixelation warning)

### **Fixes**
- Firefox support is back!
- VTE Background Images now stay after re-editing theme
- Swiping left to unpin no longer deletes the notice
- Fix profile images not loading on custom theme (patch), single user issue so hoping this works
- Stop infinite loader on RSS page by not loading modules while on select page

### **Development Notes**
- Custom Page API has now been completed (mostly)
- Compiled CSS from VTT now shows comments with what it generated
